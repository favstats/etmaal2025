# Introduction

- Representative democracy relies on fair competition between political actors  
- Campaign regulations exist to ensure fairness:  
  - Equal-time rule (US)  
  - "Second counting" rule (Europe)  
  - Campaign finance regulations  
- **Social media and targeted ads challenge these rules**

---

# Party Campaigns and Social Media

- **Targeted ads changed campaigns**
  - Personalized messages  
  - Highly specific audience segmentation  

- **Unequal playing field**
  - **"Natural" advantage**: Parties with stronger social media presence  
  - **"Artificial" advantage**: Market-driven cost differences  

---

# Research Questions

1. **Do parties pay the same price for ads?**  
2. **What drives price differences?**  

---

# Challenges in Studying Fairness

- **Observational studies** face many confounders:  
  - Content, account history, agenda, targeting settings  
- **Sock-puppet experiments** lack external validity  
- **Our approach:** Audit study using real party accounts

# Study Design

### **Context**
- **2024 European elections (June)**  
- **Platforms:** Facebook and Instagram  

### **Approach**
- Real party accounts (30 parties across 8 countries)  
- Identical **"get-out-the-vote"** ads with **same targeting settings**  
- **‚Ç¨1/day for 7 days** (starting April 29, 2024)  
- **Outcome:** Cost per 1,000 users reached  

### **Targeting Conditions**
- **No targeting** (default algorithmic audience)  
- **Interested in politics** (most likely audience)  
- **Below-university education** (least likely audience)  

### **Implication**
- **Equal prices = No distortion in competition**  
- **Unequal prices = Algorithmic bias favoring some parties**  

---

# Do Parties Pay the Same Price?

- **High variance across countries**  

![](pic/countries.png)

---

# Do Parties Pay the Same Price?

- **Within-country variation:**  
  - **4% average price difference** (up to **27%**)  
  - Small differences can lead to **millions of extra campaign impressions**

---

# Do Parties Pay the Same Price?

- **Most price variation occurs with "No Targeting" condition**  
  - More **algorithmic control ‚Üí more bias**

---

# What Explains These Price Differences?

### **1. Account-level factors**
- Spending history  
- Engagement patterns  

### **2. Party-level factors**
- Ideology  
- Electoral success  

### **3. Market-level factors**
- Audience size  
- Ad competition

# What Drives Price Differences?

# Conclusion

- **Ad algorithms (unintentionally) favor some political actors**  
- **Within-country price differences:**  
  - **4% average variation** (up to **27%**)  
  - **Significant exposure bias**  
- **Key drivers:**  
  - Audience size  
  - Spending history  
  - Ideology (?)  
  - Transnational parties (?)  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Need for stricter regulations to protect democratic fairness**  
  - **Algorithmic transparency and fairness enforcement**
