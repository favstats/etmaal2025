## Introduction

+ A well-functioning democracy requires equal competition among political entrepreneurs.
+ Campaign regulations have supported this goal:
  * Example: "second counting" rule in European countries.
+ Social media has disrupted traditional campaign dynamics.

## Party, Campaigns, and Social Media

+ Targeted advertising has transformed campaigning:
  * Mechanism: Examples from Dutch provincial elections.
+ Regulation has become more challenging.
+ Certain parties benefit:
  * Naturally: Over-representation of their voter base on social media.
  * Artificially: Lower advertising costs due to market-specific factors.

## Research Questions

+ Do parties pay the same price for ads?
+ If not, what explains these differences?

## Why Is This Hard to Study?

+ Observational studies face confounding variables: content, account history, public agenda, targeting criteria.
+ Sock-puppet experiments lack external validity.
+ Solution: Audit study using real party accounts.

## Design

+ Context: 2024 European elections.
+ Platforms: Facebook and Instagram.
+ Methodology:
  - Real parties placed identical "get-out-the-vote" ads.
  - Same conditions: €1/day for 7 days starting April 29, 2024.
+ Sample: 30 parties across 8 countries.
+ Outcome: Cost per 1,000 users reached.
+ Targeting conditions:
  - Interested in politics.
  - Below-university education.
  - No targeting.

+ Evidence that equal costs exist could suggest targeted advertising may not distort political competition—and may even enhance it.

## Do Parties Pay the Same Price?

+ Differences across countries.

## Do Parties Pay the Same Price?

+ Within-country differences:
  - 4% average deviation from the national average (maximum 27%).
  - Small differences can translate into millions of additional campaign reaches.

## Do Parties Pay the Same Price?

+ Variation across targeting conditions.

## What Factors Drive Price Differences?

+ Account-level factors: Spending history, engagement patterns.
+ Party-level factors: Ideology, electoral performance.
+ Market-level factors: Audience size, advertising competition.

+ Note: Statistical power is limited, making confounding structures difficult to parse.

+ Market-level factors.

## Conclusion

+ Ad delivery algorithms can unintentionally disrupt political competition, favoring specific political actors.
+ Within-country price variations average 4% (maximum 27%), equating to millions in biased exposure.
+ Key correlated variables:
  - Audience size.
  - Spending history.
  - Transnational party alignment.
  - Ideology.
+ Urgent need for stricter regulation to safeguard democracy, including enhanced access to algorithmic processes for broader generalizations.
